qubit gates CUDA
============

CUDA programs for clascal simulation of qubit operations, designed to be fast and memory efficient in 
order to work in large states.

This programs include some basic one and two qubit operations X,Y,Z,CNOT,... .
Plus some routines for evolving Ising spin systems, QFT and obtaining reduced density matrix.
Requires C++ libraries it++ and tclap.
